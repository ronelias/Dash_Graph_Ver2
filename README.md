# DashGraph 2.0

**Turn raw data into insights with a click. No code. No stress. Just powerful GPT-powered visualizations and EDA.**

---

## 🔍 Overview
**DashGraph 2.0** is an intelligent, user-friendly desktop application designed to simplify data exploration for everyone. Built with PyQt5 and powered by OpenAI's GPT models, DashGraph lets you load CSV files, filter and visualize data using natural language, and generate professional-grade Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reports with the help of AI.

Whether you're a data novice or a pro, DashGraph makes working with data easy, elegant, and insightful.
